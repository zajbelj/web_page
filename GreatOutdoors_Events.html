			<h3>Latta Plantation Nature Preserve:</h3>

			<p>
				It’s hard to pick favorites among the 16 miles of trail at Latta Plantation; that’s why we’ve strung together a series of interconnected loops
				involving three trails. The Hill Trail is a logical starting point, departing the nature center off Sample Road. Logical, too, in that it passes 
				one of the truly unique portions of this one-time cotton plantation: a Piedmont Prairie. Time was, such prairies were a common sight in the Piedmont, 
				though their origins remain a mystery. Prairie grasses such as little bluestem, Indian grass and switch grass, and wildflowers such as prairie 
				anemone, Georgia aster, tall larkspur and the smooth coneflowers inhabit the prairie today as they did hundreds of years ago. 
				The only thing missing from yesteryear are the bison. Another plus for this hike: brushes with Mountain Island Lake. <a href=

			<h3>Kings Mountain State Park Ridgeline Trail:</h3>
			<img id="event2" class ="tn" width = "250" height = "150" src="images/kings_mountain.jpg" alt="kings_mountain" />
			<p>
				This 15-mile connected trail segment links two states, four counties and three popular local parks together via trail, and is the first cross-county
				and cross-state trail connection for Thread Trail. This trail includes everything from Kings Pinnacle in North Carolina to bottomland forest. 
				Starting from the Visitors Center at Crowders Mountain, the trail soon encounters a short spur up to 1,705-foot Kings Pinnacle. Rocky crags and 
				stunted pines top this exposed ridge, offering nice views and scenery akin to the western part of the state. Back on the Ridgeline Trail you’ll 
				enjoy sustained climbs and descents through Piedmont hardwood forest. This lovely ramble is interrupted three times by paved roads; pay close 
				attention at each crossing. Shortly before crossing into South Carolina you’ll encounter Buzzard’s Roost at the Boulders Access Area. This area 
				dedicated to bouldering — rock climbing without ropes — is testament to the rocky terrain you’ll encounter. That is, until you cross into South 
				Carolina and the remaining trail is an easy passage through a more bottomland forest.
